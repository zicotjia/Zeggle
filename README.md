# CS3217 Problem Set 4

**Name:** Your name

**Matric No:** Your matric no

## Tips
1. CS3217's docs is at https://cs3217.github.io/cs3217-docs. Do visit the docs often, as
   it contains all things relevant to CS3217.
2. A Swiftlint configuration file is provided for you. It is recommended for you
   to use Swiftlint and follow this configuration. We opted in all rules and
   then slowly removed some rules we found unwieldy; as such, if you discover
   any rule that you think should be added/removed, do notify the teaching staff
   and we will consider changing it!

   In addition, keep in mind that, ultimately, this tool is only a guideline;
   some exceptions may be made as long as code quality is not compromised.
3. Do not burn out. Have fun!

## Written Answers

### Reflecting on your Design
> Now that you have integrated the previous parts, comment on your architecture
> in problem sets 2 and 3. Here are some guiding questions:
> - do you think you have designed your code in the previous problem sets well
>   enough?
> - is there any technical debt that you need to clean in this problem set?
> - if you were to redo the entire application, is there anything you would
>   have done differently?
